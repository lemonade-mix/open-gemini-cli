- Selection Context: KaiDex CLI can easily access your cursor's position and selected text within the editor, giving it valuable context directly from your current work.

- Native Diffing: Seamlessly view, modify, and accept code changes suggested by KaiDex CLI directly within the editor.

- Launch KaiDex CLI: Quickly start a new KaiDex CLI session from the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) by running the "Gemini CLI: Run" command.
